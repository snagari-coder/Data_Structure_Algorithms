Binary Tree -> Each node can have two or less children

Full Binary Tree -> Each node has exactly two children, except the last level of nodes. 

Complete Binary Tree -> When you write the elements of a tree from top, left -> right in an array, there are no gaps between the first and the last element of the array. 
or
a complete binary tree is a full binary tree upto level h-1, and in the last level the elements are filled from left to right.

Height of the complete binary tree is log n

Heap is a complete binary tree.

Generally arrays start from index 0, but for simplicity sake, the index of the heap represented by an array will start from 1. 

Heap can have duplicates, duplicates go into decendents. 

If a node is at index i
left child --> 2*i
right child --> 2*i + 1
parent --> floor value of i/2
