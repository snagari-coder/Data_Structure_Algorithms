The big O of traversal for both BFS or DFS is O(n), as one has to travel through each node. 

BFS:
Very useful for finding the shortest path from the root node to destination node, because we always start with the root node and the nodes closest to it. 
But the one downside is it requires more memory than DFT
If you know the location of destination, or know node is in the upper level, use BFS


DFS:
It can get slow, if the tree/graph is really deep.
If you know that the target node is in the lower level, use DFS.
Use DFS if you want to determine that a path exists between two nodes.
