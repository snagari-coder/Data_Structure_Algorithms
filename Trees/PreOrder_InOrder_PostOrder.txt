When you have depth first search ( DFS ), you have these three traversals you can do:

  InOrder traversal --> Can be used to get the items in an order , increasing order. Left, parent, right.
  PreOrder traversal --> Can be used to recreate a binary search tree. parent, left, right
  PostOrder traversal --> Left child, right child, parent
  
Most of the time DFS is done using recursion, as it quite simple to implement.
Memory consumption = O(height of the tree )
