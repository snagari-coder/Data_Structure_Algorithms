Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra Algorithms are used for finding a shortest path in a weighted graphs. 
Bellman is more effective because it can accomodate negative weighted graphs in finding the shortest path.
Bellman algo's worst case time complexity is O(n*2) and is slow. 
Dijkstra algo is faster, used for finding shortest path within non-negative weighter graphs.

JFYI - 
Linear search - O(n)
Binary search - log(n)
