Queues operations cost:
lookup = O(n) ==> We usually don't do lookup in queues or stacks
enqueue = O(1)
dequeue = O(1)
peek = O(1) ==> Just viewing the first element/data of the queue

We don't implement queue with arrays ( it is possible though ) because, after each dequeue, we have to do shift the elements of the arrays by one, which is not efficient.
