Arrays
Pros: 
1. When we know the index, it is quick to access from arrays
2. When we have to push/pop to/from the end of the array, it is quick.
3. Having something that is ordered and close to each other in memory, makes it faster to work with. 
Cons:
1. When we have to insert an element at certain index, it is slow. 
2. When we have to delete an element from certain index, it is slow. 
3. If the array is fixed sized ( static array ) then we have to declare the size of the array at the begining of the program.

Lookup - O(1)
Push/append - O(1)
insert - O(n)
delete - O(n)
