Hash maps/dictionaries:
Insert --> O(1)
delete --> O(1)
lookup --> O(1)
search --> O(1)

In python, recently the hash maps are ordered, just like arrays ( indices are ordered )

Pros:
Fast lookups
Fast Inserts
Flexible keys

Cons:
Slow key iteration, when we have to search through the keys we have to lookup the entire memory.
