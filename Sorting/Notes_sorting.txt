When to use which sorting algorithm?
Insertion sort --> When the number of inputs ( say array elements ) is small. Or when the array is almost sorted.
Bubble sort --> Never really used. Only for educational purposes.
Selection sort --> Never really used. Only for educational purposes. 
Merge sort --> Very efficient and quick (because of divide and conquer)when space complexity is not a problem. Space complexity - O(n)
Quick sort --> Almost all the sorting functions in coding languages use quick sort. Very popular. Only drawback is when you pick the pivot 
to the either the smallest/largest number of the array (worst case time complexity is O(n2)). In that case, you are not really dividing the array into half.
